## ‭‭Exodus‬ ‭13:19‬ ‭KJV‬‬

*\[19] And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.*

All of God's promises are yeah and amen in Christ. Joseph's prophecy was fulfilled here some 400 years later. Joseph like Jesus. Jesus made many prophecies but none greater than I will come again! God will surely visit you! Yes, he did and yes he will! Praise God he is coming to take us out of this world and to the promised land. We are no longer slaves to sin. We are on the way to the land flowing with milk and honey. Now that must have been exciting for that crowd to see Joseph's body being taken out of Egypt.
