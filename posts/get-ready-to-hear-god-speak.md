summary: What does it require for us to hear God speak? In Exodus 19 we read of
  the most amazing scene. God speaking from the glory cloud on the mountain to
  the children of Israel.  How did they prepare for such an event? They had to
  be clean, sanctified, and consecrated. How do we get ready.

Preparing to hear from God

‭‭Exodus‬ ‭19:9‭-‬11‬ ‭ESV‬‬

\[9] And the Lord said to Moses, “Behold, I am coming to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe you forever.” When Moses told the words of the people to the Lord, \[10] the Lord said to Moses, “Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments \[11] and be ready for the third day. For on the third day the Lord will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people. 

What a scene we are given in Exodus 19. God desires to speak to his people. He wants them to hear a see his glory on the mountain. He wants to speak to them his words of love and care.

‭‭Exodus‬ ‭19:3‭-‬6‬ ‭ESV‬‬

\[3] while Moses went up to God. The Lord called to him out of the mountain, saying, “Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the people of Israel: \[4] ‘You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles’ wings and brought you to myself. \[5] Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession among all peoples, for all the earth is mine; \[6] and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words that you shall speak to the people of Israel.”

What amazing words of promise. What wonderful encouraging words from God. But, hearing them through Moses was one thing and hearing God speak with their own ears was quite another. Preparing to hear from God is layed before us here. God tells Moses to sanctify the people, wash their clothes,  be ready, separate themselves (come not near a woman), stay within your limits. 

If we expect to hear from God in a glorious way we must do the same things. Prepare. How often do we go to church expecting to hear a wonderfully encouraging word from God to recieve another word to repent? How often do we go to get something without even a thought of preparation? Here at Sinai, they were commanded to prepare. Get the dirt of the wilderness off, wash your clothes.  They have been out here 3 months and were ldirty. We get dirty and need spiritual washing by God's word every day. Certainty, before hearing a message from God. They were told to separate themselves from the desires of the flesh. To be focused on the spiritual and not the carnal. How often do we go to church with everything on our mind except hearing from God? How often are we carnal and not walking in the Spirit? They were required to consecrate themselves. Totally dedicated to hear God. What would happen if they tried to go to God their own way? 

‭‭Exodus‬ ‭19:21‬ ‭ESV‬‬

\[21] And the Lord said to Moses, “Go down and warn the people, lest they break through to the Lord to look and many of them perish. 





They would die. God's holiness would kill them. Serious consequences indeed. We too will die a spiritual death when we continue to take God's presence and holiness lighty. We become hardened and callous to the hearing of God's word. We no longer have ears to hear. We are dead in our own selfish behavior and no longer hear God speak or see his Glory. 

What can we do? Repent and do things God's way. Wash our clothes,  separate ourselves, consecrate ourselves through obedience, prayer, and God's word. We get ready!!
