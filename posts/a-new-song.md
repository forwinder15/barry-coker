‭‭Exodus‬ ‭15:1‬ ‭KJV‬‬

\[1] Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the LORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously: The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. 

The children of Israel have been delivered from slavery and the threat of ddestruction by the army of Pharaoh and now are now passed through the Red Sea on their way to the promised land. They have experienced the fearful time of testing. They have seen the mighty hand of God through Moses. God has established him as their leader and now he leads them in a song of praise and worship. This song is filled with the gospel message. Filled with adoration and exaltation.  It is a new song that they will now sing to the Lord. The lord is my strength and my song, and he has become my salvation. The lord is victorious over the world. He is victorious over the enemy. His right hand is glorious. 

‭‭Psalm‬ ‭98:1‬ ‭KJV‬‬

O sing unto the LORD a new song; For he hath done marvellous things: His right hand, and his holy arm, Hath gotten him the victory.

Moses made a habit of singing.  Psalms 91 was written by Moses as he sang at the dedication of the tabernacle. We too should have a habit of singing. 

‭‭Ephesians‬ ‭5:18‭-‬21‬ ‭KJV‬‬

\[18] And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit; \[19] speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord; \[20] giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ; \[21] submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.
