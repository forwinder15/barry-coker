Shut in! Stand still! See the salvation! Shut up!

God led them into a place of no escape.

‭‭Exodus‬ ‭14:1‭-‬3‬ ‭

\[1] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, \[2] Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baal-zephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea. \[3] For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in. 

The test is coming and God is the only way out. It looks like they are entangled and shut it and they were afraid. Here comes Pharoah bearing down and they let Moses have it. You should've let us alone. We were better off in the world. But Moses believed God. How could they doubt him after 10 miracles? Yesterday's victories were not enough. They need God today. Moses tells them, don't do anything, just stand still! See the salvation of the lord! Don't be afraid. The lord will fight for you. Hold your peace. Shut up. Lol So our word for today. Stop, Shut up, and stand still. But wait, vs 15, God says go forward! Lift up the rod and divide the sea. Go on dry ground. The battle is the Lord's and his cloud is going to protect them as they go through the sea. God's protection in a troubled raging world is always there. The cloud never leaves them. He will never leave or forsake us.
