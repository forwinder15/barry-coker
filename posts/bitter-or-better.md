 "When God brings us to a time of testing or we going to be bitter or

  better? Are we going to murmur, grumble,and complain or are we going to see

  the miracle working power of Jehovah-Rapha?   

‭‭

  Exodus‬ ‭15:22‭-‬26 ‭KJV‬‬   \[22] So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into

  the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found

  no water. \[23] And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters

  of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah.

  \[24] And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink? \[25]

  And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tree, which when he had

  cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a

  statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them, \[26] and said, If thou

  wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that

  which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep

  all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have

  brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that healeth thee.   The Lord

  has led the children of Israel into the wilderness. Three days into the dry

  and barren wilderness where no water is. With a mixed multitude of as many as

  2 million people he leads them into the desert. Nobwater is a death sentence.

  Maybe they are down to empty water sacks now. Maybe they are now totally out

  of water. The children crying, "momma I'm thirsty." Maybe they are running

  low on water and now looking for a sorce of fresh water. It says here "they

  found no water." Truly a death sentence. It is common knowledge that 3 days

  with no water can cause severe dehydration and death. These folks are in a

  real and seriously dangerous situation. If they can't find water they will

  die. So they start grumbling against Moses. Grumbling against Moses is the

  same as grumbling against God. This is a time of bitterness. A time of Marah.

  God has led them here. How often do we complain and grumble when we are in a

  time of testing. The test is real. The danger is real. The concern is

  understandable. But, the reaction is not helpful. Moses on the other hand,

  prayed! Prayed and the lord shewed him a tree! Showed him a tree that would

  make the water sweet. That would take the bitterness away. When we are in

  these places of bitterness we can look to Calvary. A tree where Jesus took all

  the bitterness away. When he changed Marah to sweet water. Living water! This

  first mention of Marah is also the first mention of Jehovah-Rapha, the Lord

  our healer. God wants us to trust and obey. If we will trust and obey we can

  experience wells of waters under the palm trees. Now that's where I want to be

  camped."
