summary: The first of 10 commandments. You shall have no other gods before me,
  sums up the whole law. When we truly keep this one all others are kept as a

‭‭Other gods

Exodus‬ ‭20:1‭-‬3‬ ‭ESV‬‬

\[1]  And God spoke all these words, saying, \[2]  “I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. \[3]  “You shall have no other gods before me.

I believe that this first of 10 commandments, when truly obeyed, sums up them all. For if we keep this one nothing can separate us from our relationship with God. Every other god listed here is a little "g" god. Only the big "G" God is to recieve our devotion and worship. We bow to him alone. We serve him alone. But, don't forget we serve him by serving others. We love and honor him by loving others. God spoke these words, saying I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD. Certainty he brought them out of bondage. He brought us out of bondage. We were slaves to sin. These words are words of highest power. Ultimate position. The self sufficient one. The creator of heaven and earth. The Almighty. The other worldly. No one can exalt himself above him, yet that is exactly what we do when we place anything in his position. When we settle for a little "g." 

God, elohim spoke. God, Yahweh. God, eloheicha (your God). These are the names that God uses to announce himself. This is the God you are to keep first. No other elohim. No other ruler of our lives. No other judge. No other majesty. He alone deserves this position. 

So, having considered all this, what are we allowing to take his place in our lives? It is ourselves? Our selfishness and pride? Our lust and greed? Maybe it's something good even. Our love and desire for someone or our desire to succeed? I say ANYTHING that we put before God is other gods. No other gods means nothing or no one is to be before God. 

Do I have other gods?
