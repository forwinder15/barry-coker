Stay out of the mud

‭‭Exodus‬ ‭14:21‭-‬22‬ ‭KJV‬‬

\[21] And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided. \[22] And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.

The children of Israel are trapped. Walled in by mountains on the left and the right, Pharaoh and his army behind them (the cloud of God between), and the Sea in front of them. No where to go. I've felt this way so many times. So often trying to get out of the situation and only making it worse. But, they will have to wait. Wait for the rod of God to open the pathway forward. And only after God dries up the ground can they walk across. I'm sure they were anxious to leave. After all,  this situation was very uncomfortable. But had they left too soon they would be stuck in the mud. Being stuck in the mud due to impatience is so often what we do. Waiting on the word of God to lead us by the power of the Holy Spirit is the only way to stay unstuck. God is leading us forward as he prepares the ground. I think of Noah and his family who were stuck in the Ark. Sending out the dove over and over before exiting.  They were stuck in the Ark waiting for the ground to dry up. It is far better to be stuck in the Ark than stuck in the mud. It is far better to be shut in innthe wilderness than to be destroyed by the enemy, drowned in the sea, or stuck in the mud. Wait on the Lord,  again I say wait. We are never safer than when we stick with God.
