Something to dance about. 

‭‭Exodus‬ ‭15:20‭-‬21‬ ‭KJV‬‬

\[20] And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances. \[21] And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously: The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.

Here we have charismatic worship. Cymbals and dancing. The church I grew up in taught it was a sin to dance. Well, here you have it! Granted Miriam had something to dance about. Sing unto the LORD for he has triumphed gloriously, the horse and the rider he has thrown in the sea! They have witnessed a mighty work of God! They have something to sing, bang Cymbals, and dance about. What has the Lord done in our lives that makes us turn loose? He saved me! That is something to dance about.
