Jesus, ruling with a rod of iron

The rod is strength and power. Authority over all.

Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.

The Father gives his son Jesus the ultimate authority in the earth. Jesus king of kings and Lord of Lord's.

Revelations 2:27

And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.

Jesus rules with his rod of iron for he is the GREAT shepherd. He destroys with his rod, he divides with his rod, he defends with his rod, and he rules with his rod. Thank God he is my defender and my Lord! I will reign with him as part of the church as his bride with sit in his throne with him. What a glorious thought. His sceptre will not depart from him and this rod is his word.

Isaiah 11:4 

But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth with the **rod of his mouth,** and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.

In Isaiah 11 he is the rod and his word is the rod. 

Yes Jesus alone will rule this earth again!
