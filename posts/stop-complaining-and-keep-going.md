Exodus‬ ‭14:10‭-‬12‬ ‭ESV‬‬

\[10] When Pharaoh drew near, the people of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians were marching after them, and they feared greatly. And the people of Israel cried out to the Lord. \[11] They said to Moses, “Is it because there are no graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness? What have you done to us in bringing us out of Egypt? \[12] Is not this what we said to you in Egypt: ‘Leave us alone that we may serve the Egyptians’? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness. 

We often complain when we are fearful. In this situation the children of Israel had good reason. Pharoah and his army were coming to put them back in slavery. The world never wants to let us go. The yoke of bondage is ever pressing on us. Our satisfaction with the crumbs that it gives us causes us to be dissatisfied with God's leading. We grip at the spiritual leaders in our lives and to one another. Unwilling to SEE what God has for us. Just leave us alone. We're happy just like we are. ‭‭

Hebrews‬ ‭11:6‬ 

But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.

The Lord has plans for our future and it will require faith. Complaining about our circumstances is the opposite of faith. Remember the next time you complain that it reveals an unbelieving heart. A faithless outlook. The lord rebukes Moses for whining to him. 

 ‭‭Exodus‬ ‭14:15‬ ‭KJV‬‬

\[15] And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward: 

Stop complaining and keep going. Ouch, that hurts a little.
