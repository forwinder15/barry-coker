I swear, you ought to be ashamed. 

I remember these words from my youth. As a teenager it was considered cool to cuss. We boys thought it made us look "bad" and we cussed about everything. Of course, not in front of our parents or adults. When an adult hear us cussing they would say, "you should be ashamed of yourself." And so we should have. As we look at this passage, let us consider what it incompices.

‭‭Exodus‬ ‭20:7‬ ‭ESV‬‬

\[7]  “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.



While using the Lord's name in profanity is certainly included here, the implications go much deeper. The idea of "using" his name encompasses so much more. We we invoke his name we are speaking words that should bring honor. We should not swear an oath or speak words that bring shame and reproach on his name. The unsaved world is listening and God is holy and most honorable. He deserves to be honored. But, we also are bringing dishonor and judgement on ourselves.  This "vain speaking" will not go unpunished.  That alone is motivation enough. However, it goes even deeper.

‭‭Leviticus‬ ‭19:12‬ ‭ESV‬‬

\[12] You shall not swear by my name falsely, and so profane the name of your God: I am the Lord.

To make an oath or vow and break it, is to use his name in vain. When we swear falsely we bring shame in his name and on ourselves.  In the first table we see the duty of man to God. This commandment demands we honor God through truth. In addition, the 2nd table lists our duty to our neighbor. 

‭‭Exodus‬ ‭20:16‬ ‭ESV‬‬

\[16]  “You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.



When we use words of commitment and do not keep our word we break both these commandments. We're using God's name in vain. Jesus warns us on this matter. 

‭‭Matthew‬ ‭5:33‭-‬37‬ ‭ESV‬‬

\[33]  “Again you have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn.’ \[34] But I say to you, Do not take an oath at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God, \[35] or by the earth, for it is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. \[36] And do not take an oath by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black. \[37] Let what you say be simply ‘Yes’ or ‘No’; anything more than this comes from evil.

Keep your conversation simple in other words. It is better to not make any vow than to make one and break it. Covenant breaking is to use God's name in vain and bear false witness. Bring shame on the honor of God'sname. Vain speaking,  rash speaking, false swearing, and carelessness profanity is dishonoring to God and ourselves. 

I swear, we should be ashamed of ourselves when we do it.
