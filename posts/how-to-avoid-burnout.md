summary: "Moses, the prophet, priest, and leader, was overloaded with
  responsibilities. His father in law, Jethro, gives him the solution to avoid
  burnout while ministering to the massive congregation. We should apply this
  pattern as we serve in our lives to avoid becoming worn away in our
  responsibilities. "

Avoiding burnout can be challenging as we are given more and more responsibility.  In Exodus 18, we are given a pattern that will help us if we apply it.

‭‭‭Exodus‬ ‭18:13‭-‬27‬ ‭ESV‬‬

\[13] The next day Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood around Moses from morning till evening. \[14] When Moses’ father-in-law saw all that he was doing for the people, he said, “What is this that you are doing for the people? Why do you sit alone, and all the people stand around you from morning till evening?” \[15] And Moses said to his father-in-law, “Because the people come to me to inquire of God; \[16] when they have a dispute, they come to me and I decide between one person and another, and I make them know the statutes of God and his laws.” \[17] Moses’ father-in-law said to him, “What you are doing is not good. \[18] You and the people with you will certainly wear yourselves out, for the thing is too heavy for you. You are not able to do it alone. \[19] Now obey my voice; I will give you advice, and God be with you! You shall represent the people before God and bring their cases to God, \[20] and you shall warn them about the statutes and the laws, and make them know the way in which they must walk and what they must do. \[21] Moreover, look for able men from all the people, men who fear God, who are trustworthy and hate a bribe, and place such men over the people as chiefs of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens. \[22] And let them judge the people at all times. Every great matter they shall bring to you, but any small matter they shall decide themselves. So it will be easier for you, and they will bear the burden with you. \[23] If you do this, God will direct you, you will be able to endure, and all this people also will go to their place in peace.” \[24] So Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law and did all that he had said. \[25] Moses chose able men out of all Israel and made them heads over the people, chiefs of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens. \[26] And they judged the people at all times. Any hard case they brought to Moses, but any small matter they decided themselves. \[27] Then Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went away to his own country.



Here we have Moses doing the work to which he was called. He was in God's will as the appointed leaded of Israel. He was obeying God as the minister to the people. We must be clear as we serve that we are doing what God called us to do. A sure fire way to burnout is being out of God's will. In the wrong job or in the wrong ministry will lead to burnout. Everything becomes a heavy burden and dread will rule you life. So first, we must be settled in the Lord's will. But, being in the Lord's will isn't enough. We must apply principles to our work as well. Moses was trying to do the work alone. He was micro managing. Trying to answer every question and settle every dispute. Considering the size of this crowd of 2 million it is ridiculous to think one man or even several men could manage this. Moses was hearing cases morning to evening.  People standing around to be heard continually.  No break. Sounds like a busy dmv. Surely this folks were frustrated and complaining as they waited. I doubt he is greeted by kindness and friendly faces as they came to settle disputes. This crowd is not known for patience as we see them grumble over and over. Moses must accept the fact that he cannot keep on this trajectoryand avoid burnout. This leads us to understand that we too must accept that we cannot do this alone. We must accept that this is not good. So often we don't engage help because we believe it shows weakness, when actually it shows wisdom. Jethro gives Moses sage advise as he tells Moses to divide and conquer. We must understand that we alone are not the only ones who can lead people to the truth. We are not the only one who can show people the statutes and laws of God. Next, Jethro reminds Moses that his current method is not only impacting him in a negative way, but others as well. 

‭‭Exodus‬ ‭18:18‬ ‭ESV‬‬

\[18] You and the people with you will certainly wear yourselves out, for the thing is too heavy for you. You are not able to do it alone. 

When we try to do it alone it wears us out. It wears out those around us. As helpers watch their leader overloaded and unwilling to share the burden, no matter the motive, it wears out those watching. After a while the frustration of not being employed will cause those willing helpers to disappear.  The solution? Chose able people and place them in positions to share the burden. And I should remind us that God equips the called. The most important qualification is willingness. God always equips those he calls, Moses is probably the best example in scripture.  He had a speech problem and God made him the spokesman of the whole nation. These mean also feared God. They had a reputation of reverence for the things of God. Men of truth and not greedy. These are the type of people we employ in the ministry. Now we need a plan to implement that creates layers in the ministry. Only the greatest matters are to come to Moses. Only after those who serve under Moses have exhausted they resources are they to bring it to him. They are sharing the burden. Lastly, we must do it. All the discussions about why and how are meaningless if we don't do it.

‭‭Exodus‬ ‭18:24‬ ‭ESV‬‬

\[24] So Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law and did all that he had said. 

Burnout can be avoided. Delegate, Delegate, Delegate!
