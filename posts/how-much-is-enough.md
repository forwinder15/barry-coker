summary: Are we satisfied with what God gives? His presence,  his power, his
  provisions, or does greed cause us to take more than we need? A proper
  perspective on material things will lead to contentment. Greed will make our
  lives stink.

How much is enough?

‭‭Exodus‬ ‭16:19‭-‬21‬ ‭ESV‬‬

\[19] And Moses said to them, “Let no one leave any of it over till the morning.” \[20] But they did not listen to Moses. Some left part of it till the morning, and it bred worms and stank. And Moses was angry with them. \[21] Morning by morning they gathered it, each as much as he could eat; but when the sun grew hot, it melted.

How often are we unsatisfied with what God provides? Our nature cries for more. More than we need. More than our neighbor. More than we can make use of. Barns full of stuff. Closets full of stuff. Cabinets full of stuff. The children of Israel continues grumbling. Even as God leads them everyday, they complain. Several times in this chapter we are told that God hears their grumbling, yet he still provides quail at evening and manna in the morning. 

‭‭Exodus‬ ‭16:12‭-‬13‬ ‭ESV‬‬

\[12] “I have heard the grumbling of the people of Israel. Say to them, ‘At twilight you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread. Then you shall know that I am the Lord your God.’” \[13] In the evening quail came up and covered the camp, and in the morning dew lay around the camp. 



They had everything they needed. The presence of Almightyy God, his protection and provisions, freedom to worship and Iive without task masters, yet it wasn't enough. Greed drove them to gather more than necessary and it rotted. It stank! Isn't this our problem? We deserve more than other people. We deserve more than God gives. Wasn't that Eve's problem? More! 

How much is enough?

‭‭Luke‬ ‭12:16‭-‬21‬ ‭ESV‬‬

\[16] And he told them a parable, saying, “The land of a rich man produced plentifully, \[17] and he thought to himself, ‘What shall I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops?’ \[18] And he said, ‘I will do this: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. \[19] And I will say to my soul, “Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, be merry.”’ \[20] But God said to him, ‘Fool! This night your soul is required of you, and the things you have prepared, whose will they be?’ \[21] So is the one who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God.”



Again, I ask us, how much is enough?
