Motivated thinking press forward

Mature thinking 

Heavenly thinking not earthly

\    Following examples

\    Alert of enemies

\    Awaiting eagerly 

Motivated by the prize

14 I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.

Mature by our preparation (seeking training from coach Jesus)

15 Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.

Mature by our obedience 

16 Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.

Mature by pattern

17 Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample. (Toopas) hammered out

Mindful of the enemy (weeping)

18 (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:

19 Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.)

Carnal earthly worldly

Mindful of our returning savior. Looking for Jesus 

20 For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:

Look for a glorious body

21 Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.
