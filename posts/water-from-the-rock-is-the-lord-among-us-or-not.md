summary: God saves us inspite of our hard hearts. He struck the rock, Jesus,
  while we were still sinning and provided living water for our thirsty souls.
  Even as we doubt he is providing for us. Even though, we chide and tempt him
  his living water is available.

‭‭Water from the rock

Exodus‬ ‭17:1‭-‬7‬ ‭ESV‬‬

\[1]  All the congregation of the people of Israel moved on from the wilderness of Sin by stages, according to the commandment of the Lord, and camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink. \[2] Therefore the people quarreled with Moses and said, “Give us water to drink.” And Moses said to them, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test the Lord?” \[3] But the people thirsted there for water, and the people grumbled against Moses and said, “Why did you bring us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?” \[4] So Moses cried to the Lord, “What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone me.” \[5] And the Lord said to Moses, “Pass on before the people, taking with you some of the elders of Israel, and take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go. \[6] Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock at Horeb, and you shall strike the rock, and water shall come out of it, and the people will drink.” And Moses did so, in the sight of the elders of Israel. \[7] And he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah, because of the quarreling of the people of Israel, and because they tested the Lord by saying, “Is the Lord among us or not?”



In this passage we find the most profound thoughts. As the congregation of Israel traveled through the wilderness they encountered dry and barren terrain.  God is leading them to a place of blessing, but the journey will involve tests. At times it will be difficult as he taught them to rely on him in faith. The wilderness of Sin seems so appropriate a name in translated English, but actually means "clay" in Aramaic. It was believed to be a frontier Egyptian city and the surrounding desert region. A barren and dry place. Why would God lead them here? How often does he lead us to very difficult places? It is in these dry and testing situations that we experience him in a new and powerful way. The tests build our faith. But, we like them, doudt God. We become quarrelsome and temp God. The names given in verse seven reveal the lasting effect of their reactions to God's testing them. Massah means temptation. We often allow our test to become a temptation and we test God's patience and love. We doubt him and chide with others and him. Meribah means strife. So often we quarrel, complain, and temp God during the times of testing. Moses cries to God "what shall I do with this people?" I feel his frustration as I read these words. But, he took his complaint to God and God will give him direction. First, take some elders and go on ahead of the congregation. Also, take the rod. The rod that you used when I changed the Nile to blood. Now go to the rock at Horeb,  I will be standing on it. This language is so full of meaning. God's presence is on the rock! Now, Moses was told to strike the rock and he did so in front of the elders. 

Water came out of it and the people drank. Water from the rock! Jesus was also struck in the presence of the elders, sanhedrin, and water and blood came out. Jesus our rock was smitten while we were still sinning.



‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭10:1‬ ‭ESV‬‬

\[1] For I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, 

\[4] and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from the spiritual Rock that followed them, and the Rock was Christ. \[5] Nevertheless, with most of them God was not pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness.
