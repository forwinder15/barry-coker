‭‭When God makes the wheels fall off.

Exodus‬ ‭14:23‭-‬31‬ ‭KJV‬‬

\[23] And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. \[24] And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians, \[25] and took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians. \[26] And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen. \[27] And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. \[28] And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them. \[29] But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left. \[30] Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore. \[31] And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses. 

Never is never stronger than when we see God protect us from the enemy. When we see his mighty hand at work doing what we never dreamed possible it brings great awe and reverence of him. It's interesting that during this entire night that the glory cloud blocked the view. But, the lord saw through the cloud. He knew exactly where the enemy was and troubled them. He made the chariot wheels fall off! He would not let that army new his children. The Lord is always protecting us. Even when it's dark and we cannot see the enemy. We rarely know how dangerous the situation is. We're in the glory cloud of God's presence.  Protected and shielded from harm. When we look back we see the destruction of the enemy and his plan and fear. We believe the Lord. We believe and rejoice.
