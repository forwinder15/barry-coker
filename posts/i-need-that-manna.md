I need that manna.

‭‭Exodus‬ ‭16:31‭-‬35‬ ‭ESV‬‬

\[31] Now the house of Israel called its name manna. It was like coriander seed, white, and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey. \[32] Moses said, “This is what the Lord has commanded: ‘Let an omer of it be kept throughout your generations, so that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.’” \[33] And Moses said to Aaron, “Take a jar, and put an omer of manna in it, and place it before the Lord to be kept throughout your generations.” \[34] As the Lord commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it before the testimony to be kept. \[35] The people of Israel ate the manna forty years, till they came to a habitable land. They ate the manna till they came to the border of the land of Canaan. 

Everyday the children of Israel recieved their portion. One day at a time they gather their provisions. Only on the day of sabbath are they to gather two days worth so as to keep the sabbath holy. Friday at 6 pm sabbathbegan so their gathering would be complete. This habitual behavior continued forry years during the wilderness journey. Also, they are to gather a portion of this manna into a vessel and place it in the Ark of the covenant that will be built soon. It will be kept as a reminder of God's supernatural provisions and their perpetual need. The word mamma comes from the Hebrew word man hu and means, "what is it?" It is described as looking like coriander seed and tasting like wafers with honey. But, what is more that the signicance of it's physical benefits it reminds them of their total dependence on the Lord. Just like they need mamma each day so do we. Man cannot live by bread alone but by every word that comes from the mouth of God. We need manna every day to nourish our hungry souls and the only bread that satisfies is Jesus. We need that manna.

Jesus's words say it all. The 5000 wanted more physical bread from him, but he reminds them of their need of a ongoing daily eternal relationship to the true manna.





‭‭John‬ ‭6:48‭-‬51‬ ‭ESV‬‬

\[48] I am the bread of life. \[49] Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. \[50] This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that one may eat of it and not die. \[51] I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. And the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.”



Again I say, I need that manna!
