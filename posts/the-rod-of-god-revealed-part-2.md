Psalms 23:4

Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou \[art] with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.

Probably the most famous passage of scripture on the rod and the staff. I just want to focus on what the shepherd is using his shepherd tools for. 1st he provides. I shall not want. I can rely on him to provide with his rod and staff. He makes me lie down in green pastures. The shepherd uses his staff to MAKE the sheep lie down. I'm not even capable of resting without the rod and staff. He leads me beside still waters. Using his great staff. He restores my soul. He leads me in paths of righteousness. I have no ability to pick the right path. Especially in the valley of shadows of death and fear and evil. God leads his dear children along. Thy rod and thy staff comfort me! I know you have my back Lord. You goodness and mercy FOLLOW me! 

Now I challenge you. Read that Psalm with God's word in mind each time he reveals the rod and staff. The rod of protection and discipline and the staff of direction and provision. 



Thank you Great Shepherd for laying down your life for the sheep!
