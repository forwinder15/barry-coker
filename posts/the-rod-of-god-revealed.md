Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily in the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.

Micah 7:14 

 We will be focusing on the shepherd's rod. According to my initial research the word is mentioned 81 times in 16 books. And 32 times the word staff. Psalm 23:4 says thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. In Micah 7 the Lord feeds them with the rod. I'm excited to put together this study on the rod and the staff to illustrate the physical and spiritual significance of these powerful shepherd's tools. 

First, let's stop and consider the rod used to feed the children of Israel.

Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily in the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.

Micah 7:14 

So right away we know that the shepherd is meant here to feed his flock with this rod.

Let's start by looking at the law of first mention.

Exodus 4:2

And the LORD said unto him, What \[is] that in thine hand? And he said, A rod.

Moses was tending sheep in the back side of the desert when he encounters God in a miraculous way. Notice how God has Moses use a tool he was very familiar with. God is going to use Moses to shepherd the people from Egypt to the promised land. All the way using the rod.

Exodus 4:17

And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs.

This rod is going to be used powerfully and 

Often in the life of Moses and his people

First, I believe the rod represents the power and authority of God. 

When Pharaoh tries to match God's power look what happens.

Exodus 7:12

For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.

Yes, God has absolute authority over the world and the devil. All through the miracles of Exodus you will find Moses and Aaron lifting up the rod.

Exodus 14:16

But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry \[ground] through the midst of the sea.

The rod is also used to divide or separate. When raised above the Red Sea the waters divided. And then later used to separate the herds.

Leviticus 27:32

And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, \[even] of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD.

Okay a little review. The rod is representative of God's power and authority and his demand that we be separated from the world. Wholly different and devoted.

Numbers 17:2

Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of \[their] fathers, of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods: write thou every man's name upon his rod.

Numbers 17:3

And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for one rod \[shall be] for the head of the house of their fathers.

Now God uses the rod to separate Aaron to be set apart as in priesthood. Giving him authority to perform the duty of the ministry.

Much more to come. However, I would like you to consider something as we go. Each time the word rod is mentioned, see if "the word of God"  can be substituted. I think we will see a strong pattern of these two powerful tools.

And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand. So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed. But Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.

Exodus 17:9‭-‬12

Sitting on a Rock holding up the rod. I just want to emphasize the significance of the rod in Moses' life. In this passage he carried this tool that he knew so well into battle. Moses was responsible to hold up the rod in order that the men would see it and prevail. Notice he carried it up on a hill. He is holding it up and Joshua prevailed. When we hold up the Word of God, Jesus prevails. This is also a very beautiful picture of prayer. We should pray the word of God. It is the guarantee of our victory. The promises of God are contained in our rod. Also, notice Moses was weary. He needed help holding up his hands. What was in his hand? Moses what is in your hand? Over and over through the victories of Egypt the rod was in his hand! Oh my! Our victory is sure when we have the rod in our hand. Notice also that Moses sat on a stone. He got tested in the solid foundation of the rock as he interceded for the army of God. We must rest in the rock of Jesus as we lift high the rod for all to see. Don't you believe that all of Israel had seen Moses holding the rod miracle after miracle? Oh that we would always hold up God's word for all to see as we pray for the victory!

What happens when the rod is used wrongly? 

Moses can tell us.

Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink. And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him. And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock? And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also. And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them. This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them.

Numbers 20:8‭-‬13

We know that Moses was to speak to the rock and yet he smote it twice. The rock here represents Jesus. When we misuse the bible it is like sticking Jesus himself. Moses was angry and this action cost he and Aaron the privilege of the promise land. A terrible price to pay for misusing the rod. When we misuse the Lord's word we cause irreversible damage to ourselves and others. Oh Lord help us to always handle your word with utmost care.
