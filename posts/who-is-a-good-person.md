I started reading the condemning prophecy of Micah. It is filled with strong language and severe judgement and  beautiful pictures of the millennial reign. I didn't feel led to dive deeply into the near and far fulfilment of God's word to Judah and Samaria through Micah. Then I came to this: He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?

Micah 6:8 

So direct is this requirement. He, God, has showed you what is good. Everything we know that is good. Everyone we know who are good, received this understanding from God's revealing to us his character and his ways. I'm so grateful to know the source of all Goodness.

And he only requires we do justly, that which is right and honorable. That we love mercy. Pity and compassion defines us as spirit filled believers. Loving a merciful Savior and loving others as he did. Walking with God every moment in humility. We have a right understanding of our lowly position in God's kingdom. Knowing that only by mercy and through his grace are we saved. This passage defines us a Christian. Walking with the Lord displaying all that is good. Justly, loving mercy, and humbly we reveal the Lord to the world.
